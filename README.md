# edge-32bit-soft-core-Processor
edge32 is 32 bit processor designed for FPGAs in VHDL features 4096x32 RAM, 26 bit Timer, timer interrupt and 32 x 32 register file that can be used to accomplish simple sequential tasks running on FPGA! 
the sample program to test in ROM.vhd almost consists of each instructions designed to get an idea of Usage of them.
the timer interrupt sets Program counter to value specified in Control engine which can be change only by changing it in code.
